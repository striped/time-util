# Working day arithmetic & etc

This utility tool provides basic functionality for the calculation of the working days to the corresponding calendar 
date; namely translating working days into calendar dates and vise versa. Often it is necessary for business 
applications to follow only labour days, specifics to that or other religious or cultural traditions of the designated 
region.

Intention to offer this to the public was dictated due to the lack of such functionality in standard and / or widely 
adopted tools. Existing solutions are based on brute force iteration that is working well but still have questionable
efficacy. Albeit, the simple arithmetic of such translation between the calendar days and working ones is 
straightforward.

[Working day arithmetics] [workweek] for a traditional 5 days workweek (i.e. Christian) based on the following facts 
that are observed always and are true by definition:

* Each year has the exact number of weeks, 52,
* Each week has 7 calendar days,
* Each week has 5 working days.

Thus, translation between the calendar and the working days might be as trivial as the relation observed as a stepped 
integer dependency between days devoted to labour and the calendar days. Indeed, it is essentially sufficient to add 
the weekend each time when the number of calendar days exceed the working week length. Saying that, the formulas for 
the traditional five working day week translations should look like:

```math
<Calendar Days> = âŒŠ (<Day of Week> + <Working Days>) / 5 âŒ‹ * 7
<Working Days> = âŒŠ (<Day of Week> + <Calendar Days>) / 7 âŒ‹ * 5
```

The similar thoughts can be applied for any other existing workweek: 6 days per week or with sabbath that falls on 
Friday and Saturday only. Albeit, small adjustment to the calculations is necessary to make the stepped function to 
work when numerical value of the weekend's *&lt;Day of Week&gt;* doesn't fall to the end of the week. However, *all 
such calculations might be done in constant time, without looping through all days in question to check whether it is
labour day or not.* 

However, the holidays can't be calculated so easily. Some of them don't have a fixed calendar date and are floating from 
year to year. For instance, Easter is observable in first Sunday after full Moon occurring on or after Spring Equinox.
In terms of Gregorian calendar this day vary between 22 of March and 25 of April. Albeit, exact day is possible to 
calculate, such exercise would not be satisfactory, given it is only one holiday beside many ones across different
cultures and traditions. Another aspect of this matter lies in how such details would be used for working day to 
calendar translation. Discussed above solution helps to consider weekends in the required calendar period so, to
consider also holidays it would be sufficient to check how many days are that ones between start and end calendar 
dates. Thus, the static dictionary approach would look very much suitable in such circumstances. Simply checking how 
many holidays fell in questionable calendar interval, we may adjust it to satisfy an arbitrary number of requested
working days. Such "holiday dictionary" in form of balanced BST would do this in logarithmic time for arbitrary 
chronological period of time, limited only by business requirements and / or the available heap. Once loaded and 
balanced, it can be used many times, within guaranteed computational complexity.

# Usage

Utilities for calendar days calculation realized for both Java 8 and modern releases in form of simple utility as 
well as [j.t.t.TemporalAdjuster](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/time/temporal/TemporalAdjuster.html)
for convenience of usage:

```java
static final TemporalAdjuster THIRTY_DAYS_BEFORE=WorkingWeek.MONDAY_FRIDAY.adjustDaysBefore(30);
		...
		LocalDate date=...
		LocalDate reviewDate=date.with(THIRTY_DAYS_BEFORE);
// reviewDate is exact 30 working days before the date
```

Implied before/after semantic may be useful in necessity approach the target day from either side. As example, let's
consider adjusting to `0` working days. For instance, to adjust to previous working day:

```java
static final TemporalAdjuster PREV_BUSINESS_DAY=WorkingWeek.MONDAY_FRIDAY.adjustDaysBefore(0);
		...
		LocalDate date=LocalDate.now().with(PREV_BUSINESS_DAY);
// the date guaranteed be this day or before, if today is weekend
```

and if target date is today or the future:

```java
static final TemporalAdjuster NEXT_BUSINESS_DAY=WorkingWeek.MONDAY_FRIDAY.adjustDaysAfter(0);
		...
		LocalDate date=LocalDate.now().with(NEXT_BUSINESS_DAY);
// the date guaranteed be this day or after, if today is weekend
```
