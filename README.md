# time-util

Date/Time related utilities provides basic arithmetics quite often necessary in Java application.

The origin of this library was dictated the lack of functionality in standard and / or widely used approach or when it's
efficiency is questionable. As an example let's see the business day calculation that implemented in that or another 
form in quite wide variety of Java application. Yet, the simple arithmetic to translate the standard calendar days into 
working days may wonder in forms of implementations existing on Internet.

Hope this one under MIT license may be helpful.
